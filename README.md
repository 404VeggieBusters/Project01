About The Project:
In previous breakout rooms, Ronald, Valbona and Jessica had bonded over health and eating right (plant based). Valbona and Jessica are both vegan, whereas Ronald is a vegetarian. Ricardo has also been thinking about transitioning into a plant based lifestyle for quite some time now. Our own personal lived experiences played a major role into our project idea/brainstorming process. We figured that it's best to address two problems simultaneously. 

Our target audience are individuals who are looking for local plant based (vegan/vegetarian) restaurants, recipes to create at home, or just browsing restaurants in a new city that they may travel to.  The problem that Plane with Plants addresses is the lack of a plant based restaurant directory and recipes that are vegan or vegetarian. 

Our project solves that problem by not only assists users in finding plant based restaurants based off their geolocation or the city that they search, but it also provides vegan and vegetarian recipes when the user types in a specific ingredient. 

The wonderful thing is that we have given users the opportunity to do it all on one page. Regardless of if you are transitioning your food lifestyle and looking to incorporate more healthy items, a 5-year vegan fanatic, or someone who eats meat but also enjoys their veggies on the side, Plane with Plants is the best web application to visit. We truly believe that our website is top-quality and delivers more than a minimum viable product.

We all have a unique food journey that has led us here (team members), but we all stated that we will definitely visit the page often to try some things. 


Built With:
This project was masterfully created with HTML, CSS (and Materialize), JavaScript, JSON, and Third Party APIs. 


Prerequisites:
The prerequistites for project one are: 

1. Use at least two server side APIs

6. Must not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (look into modals)
7. Must be deployed to GitHub Pages
8. Must be interactive (i.e. accept and respond to user input)


Usage:
    This web application is very user-friendly and accessible. (insert screenshots of website here, sample code of local storage, and from materialize CSS framework - Jess). 


Contributing:
    During this project, we all worked extremely hard as a team. We did not leave a member behind at all. In fact, we assisted one another in each area and would pseudocode in different parts of the project, as we saw fit.
    
   As a team, we all worked on the index.html. Ricky and Valbona did the styling using CSS and its framework, Materialize. Ronald and Jessica did the JavaScript, JSON and other back-end development.
